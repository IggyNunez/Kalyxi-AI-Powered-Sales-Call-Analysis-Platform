# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Icon Requirements

- PNG format with transparent background
- Use the Kalyxi brand colors
- Should be recognizable at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can use any design tool (Figma, Illustrator, etc.) to create these icons.
Export each size separately as PNG files.

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use simple colored squares:

- Create solid color squares in your brand color
- Add them as placeholder icons until final designs are ready
